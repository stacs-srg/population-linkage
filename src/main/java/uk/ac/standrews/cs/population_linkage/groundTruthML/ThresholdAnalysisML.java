/**
 * This class is the base class for performing linkage analysis from ground truth.
 * Classes extending this class are required to implement the following method:
 *     getComparisonFields(), returns the set of fields to be used for distance comparison from the data source
 * Known subclasses are:
 * AllPairsSameSourceLinkageAnalysisML, which compares records from a single data source
 * TwoSourcesLinkageAnalysis, which compares records from two different data sources
